# Miscellaneous Projects

Welcome! In this repository i have some miscellaneous projects that I did in the past. Most of them were made in a time with less programming experience, and with an educational purpose.

Descriptions of the programs in this directory can be found below.


# rony
An R package with general utility functions for working with time series. The most interesting functions are a generalized Dickey-Fuller t-test and an auto ARIMA model selector based on minimal AIC.

It was done after the end of the class "Econometria II" at FGV-EESP in 2020. This was the course that got me into R, and I decided to create a package with some of the functions I created for the assignments.

Some minor organization/aesthetic changes were made, to improve readability. Mainly using the styler package.


## exer-colab
A R Shiny App that uploads problem sets written in RMarkdown to a platform where anyone can answer and post their answers. The answers can contain text, images, and code, which is evaluated an printed in real time.

Made as a companion to R classes I was teaching in 2023. Some minor organization/aesthetic changes were made, to improve readability.

The app was hosted at https://ricardo-semiao.shinyapps.io/ExerColab/.


## ml-classification
A standard ML Classification project I did to train my data science skills with Python. The theme was credit card default. Made in 2023.


## sequence_creator
A program that generates various different numerical sequences based on the inputs desired by the user. Made in 2020.

It was the first or second "full" Python program I made, and it was my admission to [GVCode](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fgvcode), the student's programming league of FGV. I passed! And would later spent three years at it, becoming even vice president.


## lol_champion_stats
A program that accesses the League of Legends wiki page, retrieves information about selected champions using web scraping (Beautiful Soup), calculates the "Effective Health" of several champions, and plots graphs with these values using Matplotlib. Made in 2022.


## solver_plagiarism_detection
The final project for the elective Excel course at FGV. Made in 2020.

There was no standard theme/difficulty set, and I choose to do an algorithm designed to optimize the parameters of a predictive model by minimizing the error between the prediction and the actual value.
